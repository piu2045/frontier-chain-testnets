# Frontier Chain Testnets

A repo for coordinating genesis transactions and sharing genesis files for Frontier Chain testnets.
Security

Polkadot network provides sharing security. Based on the blockchain developed by substrate, if a slot is obtained as a parallel link to the relay chain, it can obtain tens of billions of dollars of security. However, the parallel chain team needs to pay the slot rent by issuing its own token, which is about tens of millions of dollars per year. For a platform chain that can carry many applications, the cost may be cost-effective. But it's only an applied blockchain. Is the cost-benefit reasonable.

Octopus network provides flexible and low-cost on-demand rental security. The application chain can decide how much security it needs, and then bear the corresponding rental cost. If you start with a small app, maybe $1 million in security is enough. So if the application chain issues an additional $100000 token every year as a node reward, that is to say, paying $100000 rent will attract the verifier to pledge $1 million OCT to provide security for the application chain. As time goes on, the network effect of this chain may be stronger and stronger, the economic activities are more and more, the token price is also rising, more people will pledge, and the security of this chain will be higher and higher. If you want to reduce the expenditure on security, the application chain can decide to reduce the node reward through on chain governance, so as to reduce the additional issuance.

At the same time, the current Polkadot network has only 100 parallel chains that can be connected to the relay chain, and there may be less than 10 slots available this year, while Octopus network has no such limit.

Interoperability

Octopus network is based on near protocol, and its application chain can be interoperable with near. Near has rainbow bridge, through which the application chain can interoperate with Ethereum. In the future, near, cosmos and Polkadot will also be connected together, and the application chain can interoperate with these chains. Through the substratibc module developed by Octopus network, the application chain can interoperate with all the chains based on Cosmos SDK.

Infrastructure and community

Octopus network will provide some common infrastructure, such as blockchain browser, RPC gateway, indexer, etc., which will be provided to the application chain for free. At the same time, octopus network is a community composed of Web 3.0 developers, investors and disseminators. The investors either act as angels of the application chain or pledge to provide security for the application chain network.

In a word, the mission of Octopus network is to lower the threshold of Web3.0 application innovation.
